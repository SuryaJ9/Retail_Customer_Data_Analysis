### ⚙️ **Project Workflow**

#### 🧹 Step 1: Data Cleaning

```python
# Handle missing values
df['Returns'].fillna(0, inplace=True)

# Convert date column
df['Purchase Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Purchase Date'])
```

#### 📊 Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

```python
# Revenue by category
df.groupby('Product Category')['Total Purchase Amount'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False)
```

#### 📈 Step 3: Visualization

```python
import seaborn as sns
sns.barplot(x='Age', y='Total Purchase Amount', data=df)
```

#### 🔎 Step 4: Churn Analysis

```python
df.groupby('Age')['Churn'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False)
```

#### 🧾 Step 5: Insight Generation

Translate data patterns into **business recommendations** using the **Pyramid Principle**:

> *Insight → Evidence → Recommendation*

Example:

> 💡 *Customers aged 25–35 generate 40% of revenue but churn 20% more than others.*
> 🎯 *Recommendation:* Launch personalized loyalty programs for this segment.
